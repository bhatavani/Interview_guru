**An AI-Powered Mock Interview Platform**

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

## 🧠 Problem Statement

> 📊 *According to NASSCOM (2024), 85% of students in Tier 2/3 cities and rural India lack real interview exposure. Approximately 78% face rejection during the initial screening due to low confidence, weak communication skills, and limited awareness of industry expectations.*

There is a clear demand for an accessible, AI-driven platform that enables students to practice interviews, receive real-time feedback, and continuously develop their professional communication skills.
